# SimpleDailyJournal

SimpleDailyJournal is a straightforward ASP.NET Core MVC application designed to manage journal entries, demonstrating CRUD operations, form validation, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Journal Entry Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view entries with mood tracking.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Leverages jQuery validation for instant feedback.
- **Server-Side Validation**: Ensures data integrity using ASP.NET Core's data annotations.
- **Enum-based Mood Selection**: Consistent and user-friendly mood tracking.
- **Responsive UI**: Styled with Bootstrap for clean, responsive layouts.
- **Static Pages**: Includes About Us and Privacy pages for a polished structure.
- **Date-Range Filtering**: Filter journal entries by a specific date range to analyze mood trends.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the required dependencies with `dotnet restore`.
3. Run migrations to set up the database:

   ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Navigate to http://localhost:7055 to view the app.

### Sentiment Analysis

The application uses a simple sentiment analysis integration built on **ML.NET** to 
predict whether a journal entry conveys a positive or negative sentiment. It analyzes 
a combination of the journal’s content and mood selection to provide insightful results.

### Example Usage:

1.  **Add Journal Entries**: Provide a date, content, and select a mood.

2.  **Analyze Entries**: Use the “Analyze Sentiments” feature to filter entries by a date 
range and mood. Analyze trends and patterns in the journal entries’ sentiments.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**:

*    ASP.NET Core MVC
*    Entity Framework Core
*    ML.NET (for sentiment analysis)

**Frontend**:

* Bootstrap (for styling)
* jQuery and jQuery Validation (for client-side interactivity and validation)

**Database**: SQLite (lightweight and easy to set up for development)

## Future Enhancements

    •	Integration with more advanced analytics or sentiment analysis for mood tracking.
    •	Improved UI/UX with richer styling options.
